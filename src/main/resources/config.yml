karma-ratio: 0.001

# From the official TTT documentation:
#
# All karma penalties are based on damage dealt. The kill penalty is just an extra amount of "damage" dealt

# When a player's Karma is above the starting level (meaning the karma max has been configured to be higher than
# that), all his karma increases will be reduced based on how far his karma is above that starting level. So it
# goes up slower the higher it is.

#     continuous - Players may join rounds at will, but will not be ejected when it ends.
#                  Instead, the arena will reset to its initial state and a new round will begin.
#     dedicated - Only one round will exist on the server, which players will be entered into upon connecting.
#                 After a time or round limit (whichever comes first), the server will switch to a new arena.
# If the set value is not valid, it will default to 'standard'.

#     sequential - Arenas will be selected in a fixed order determined by the engine.
#     random - Arenas will be selected completely randomly.
