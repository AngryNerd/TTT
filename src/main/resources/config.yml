##############################

# What should the ratio of traitors to innocents be (as a decimal)?
traitor-pct: 0.25

detective-pct: 0.13

# If at least this many players are in a game, there is guaranteed to be a detective.
detective-min-players: 10

# How many seconds should the DNA scanner take to charge?

scanner-charge-time: 7.5

##################
# Title Settings #
##################

# Should TTT send fancy titles to players on round start and end?
# This will not do anything on Minecraft versions prior to 1.8.
send-titles: true

# If true, status titles (event.g. "You are a traitor!") will be sent as subtitles. If false, normal titles will be
# sent. Setting this to true may cause the title to be obstructed by the chat box.
small-status-titles: false

# If true, victory titles (event.g. "The traitors won!") will be sent as subtitles. If false, normal titles will be
# sent. Setting this to false may cause the title to not fit on the screen for certain locales (such as de_DE).
# Setting this to true may cause the title to be obstructed by the chat box.
small-victory-titles: true

###################
# Weapon Settings #
###################

# The item to use as a gun. This should be a raw Material enum value.
# See here for all valid values: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
crowbar-item: IRON_SWORD

# The item to use as a gun. This should be a raw Material enum value.
# See here for all valid values: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html

# How many arrows should be given to players upon the round starting?
initial-ammo: 40

##################
# Karma Settings #
##################

# When strict is off, the damage penalty is very low when people stay above 800.
# However, beyond this limit it will follow a more parabolic curve, dropping more severely the lower the player's karma.
karma-strict: true

# What karma should players initially be given?
karma-starting: 1000

# What should the maximum allowed karma be?
# (After this is reached, the player will not receive karma until they go below it again.)
karma-max: 1000

# What ratio should be used when determining the karma taken when a player damages their ally? (0-1)
karma-ratio: 0.001

# From the official TTT documentation:
# All karma penalties are based on damage dealt. The kill penalty is just an extra amount of "damage" dealt
# when you kill someone. So if this was 100, and you headshot someone with a rifle, it would penalise you as
# if you dealt 200 damage.
karma-kill-penalty: 15

# How much karma should be allocated to each player at the end of a round?
karma-round-increment: 5

# How much karma should be allocated to players who avoided damaging or killing teammates during a round at the end?
karma-clean-bonus: 30

# At what point should the clean bonus be halved? (The default value of 0.25 sets it a quarter of the way between
# the starting karma and the maximum.)
karma-clean-half: 0.25

# What ratio should be used when determining the karma given when an innocent damages a traitor? (0-1)
karma-traitordmg-ratio: 0.0003

# How much karma should be given when an innocent kills a traitor? (Scaled by traitordmg-ratio and the victim's karma.)
karma-traitorkill-bonus: 40

# Players will be kicked from the round once they reach or go under this karma level. (Set to -1 for no autokick.)
karma-low-autokick: 450

# Should player's be temporarily banned from using the plugin rather than kicked?
karma-low-ban: false

# How long in minutes should users be banned from using the plugin for? (Set to -1 for a permanent ban.)
# Note: changing this will not retroactively apply to previously issued bans.
karma-low-ban-minutes: 60

# Should karma persist through reloads and PlayerQuitEvents (players leaving)? (If false, karma will reset when
# the plugin is reloaded and when players leave the server.)
karma-persist: true

# Should damage dealt by users be negatively impacted by karma? (Full damage is done at 1000.)
karma-damage-reduction: true

# Should added or subtracted karma be rounded up to 1 if it is between 0 and 1?
karma-round-to-one: true

# When true, karma changes will be logged to the console. Note that this will typically cause massive log spam.
karma-debug: false

#######################
# Scoreboard Settings #
#######################

# TTT uses Minecraft's scoreboard system to display player karma and status.
# This section allows you to configure the formatting used to denote various states.
# Please note that team prefixes (innocent/traitor/detective) are displayed before life prefixes (alive/mia/dead).
# Protip: ALT+21 is the Windows shortcut for a section symbol (ยง). :)

# The prefix for alive players.
sb-alive-prefix:

# The prefix for missing-in-action players.
sb-mia-prefix: ยง7

# The prefix for confirmed dead players.
sb-dead-prefix: ยงm

# Setting this to true will cause TTT to use the sidebar to display the karma scoreboard, as opposed to the player list.
# We highly recommend you leave this false, as it nearly crashed our testing server the last time we tested it.
# The backend has since been rewritten (twice), but we haven't retested this display mode.
#
# We disclaim all responsibility for damages and/or frustration caused by this "feature."
sb-use-sidebar: false

###################
# Plugin Settings #
###################

# Should potentially unnecessary information be logged?
verbose-logging: true

# What locale should be used by default? (TTT will attempt to send messages to players in their respective locale, but
# will fall back to this. This will also be used for console messages.
locale: en_US

# Should the plugin update itself? (recommended)
enable-auto-update: true

# Allow me to collect anonymous usage information? (Pretty please? :3)
enable-metrics: true
